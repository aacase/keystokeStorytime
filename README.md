## Keystoke StoryTime!



Greetings and Welcome to my sample mean app created for Keystoke's coding challenge! The purpose of the app is simple. You can sign up, or sign in. From there, you can look at stories that other people have created, or fill out a verrrry short quiz and generate a story of your own! Once you're done with your story, a copy is sent via email to the address you specified on sign up.

If you'd like to check out a live version of the app, you can do so here:

The phonegap build is available here:

##Known Issues:

The submission process for the quiz is being completed automatically due to the way pagination is currently set up. I'm working on a fix for this now.

The update function is half working, meaning that the records are updating to the DB, but they are not being reflected into the compiled version of the story. I'm looking into this.
